/**
 * SumVector is the model of a sum vector. A sum vector is the sum of all vectors for one VectorSet.
 * However, it's not as simple as just a quick add up, as vectors can change states and go from being on the graph to
 * off of the graph or vise versa.
 *
 * SumVectors can be directly manipulated. They can be translated, but not rotated or scale.
 *
 * SumVectors are created at the start of the sim, and exist for the lifetime of the sim.
