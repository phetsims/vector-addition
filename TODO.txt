TODO list for vector-addition

Should sumVisibleProperty be per scene or global? what about Lab?

VectorAdditionColors.EQUATION_SUM_FILL and EQUATION_SUM_STROKE should be in VectorColorPalettes

Equation: different look for base vectors, gray

Equation: Base Vectors accordion box overlaps radio buttons

Zero-length sum vector label should not be centered on tail location

Make origin manipulator smaller, expand pointer areas

Disable eraser button when there are no vectors to erase.

Collapse equation scenes to one graph for each snap mode.

Tick labels on graph

Change vector drag bounds and 'drag off' behavior

Vector toolbox and radio buttons have a very similar look, and are close together. Will there be confusion?
