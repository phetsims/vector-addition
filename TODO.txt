TODO list for vector-addition

DONE: #110 checkbox for 'c' and 'f' vectors
DONE: #139, #150 Disable eraser button when there are no vectors to erase.
DONE: #153 Equation: different look for base vectors, opaque gray

VectorAdditionColors.EQUATION_SUM_FILL and EQUATION_SUM_STROKE should be in VectorColorPalettes

Zero-length sum vector label should not be centered on tail location

#148 Collapse equation scenes to one graph for each snap mode.

#152 Change vector drag bounds and 'drag off' behavior

#140 alignment problem with coefficients in equations

#136 add cueing arrows to vector head

#134 layout of stuff to right of graph

#128 layout of stuff above the graph

#127 adjust graph range and MVT

#127 Make origin manipulator smaller, expand pointer areas

#112 Vector Values for 's' are shown after Sum is unchecked

#107 polish icons on snap mode radio buttons

#99 Tick labels on graph

#94 sum vector associated with selected vector should be in front

#93 mitigate overlapping labels

#107, #134 Equation: Base Vectors accordion box overlaps radio buttons

DESIGN: Should sumVisibleProperty be per scene or global? what about Lab?

DESIGN: Vector toolbox and radio buttons have a very similar look, and are close together. Will there be confusion?

DESIGN: Do we need to show components for base vectors? See TODO in EquationSceneNode
