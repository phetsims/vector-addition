Vectors are constrained to horizontal and vertical orientations. 

In the horizontal orientation:
* the y component of all vectors is zero
* the sum vector computation is a&#8407; + b&#8407; + c&#8407; = s&#8407;. 

In the vertical orientation
* the y component of all vectors is zero
* the sum vector computation is d&#8407; + e&#8407; + f&#8407; = s&#8407;.
